LogoAI.. It offers a system for you to generate logos with the tap of a click. It uses the T3 Stack (Prisma, NextAuth, NextJs, React, Tailwind) with Planetscale for a serverless MySQL platform, AWS S3 for storing and caching images, AWS Amplify for hosting, AWS Route 53 for domain and DALL-E AI API for image generation AI with fine tuning.

Might open-source in the future.
